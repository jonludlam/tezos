Version 12.0~rc2
================

Version 12.0 contains a new version (V4) of the protocol environment,
which is the set of functions that protocols can call. This new
version is used by protocol Ithaca, which is a proposal for the
successor of Hangzhou. This release candidate also contains Ithaca
itself as well as its daemons (baker and accuser â€” there is no
endorser for Ithaca) and the ``ithacanet`` built-in network alias
for the Ithacanet test network.

The second release candidate (12.0~rc2) replaces protocol Ithaca
(``PsiThaCa``) with Ithaca2 (``Psithaca2``) and updates the
``ithacanet`` built-in network alias to the new version of Ithacanet,
which uses protocol Ithaca2 instead of Ithaca. This second release
candidate also includes a number of bug fixes and improvements related
to Ithaca and to the storage backend.
